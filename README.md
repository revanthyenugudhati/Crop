In the face of global population growth and climate change, plant breeders and agronomists strive for improved crop yields and quality to ensure regional food security, regulate the market price of the rice grain, and address food-shortage problems. The rice-panicle density is one of the important agronomic components in understanding the grain yield and determining the growth period Computer-vision methods based on high-spatial-resolution images provide a potential solution to increase the throughput and the accuracy . With the development of deep learning methods, convolutional neural networks have been shown to outperform human beings in diverse fields.
The project uses low-cost remote sensors to deliver easy to understand, robust information to farmers enabling the precision application of fertilizer and other inputs. guidelines will be developed to indicate plant health and growing condition, nutrient and water deficiencies/excesses. The final product will be a mobile application and a web browser-based information dashboard that compares baseline dataset and farmerâ€™s images and provides site-specific information and advice!
